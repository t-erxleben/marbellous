# Marbellous

Marbellous will be a WebApp to generate [paper marbling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_marbling) patterns.
We aim for the best possible performance by using WebASM and WebGL.
The project is still in an early state so most of the functionality is still missing.

## How to use

You can play with the current version at [github pages](https://t-erxleben.github.io/marbellous).
