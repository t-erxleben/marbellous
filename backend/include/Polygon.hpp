    /** Compute the number of vertices needed for a "circle" to appear smooth.
     * Canvas size is loaded from the options.
     * 
     * Math explanation: 
     * The distance between two vertices should be close to the distance between two pixels
     * The canvas is defined within [-1,1], meaning that its length is 2 
     * 
     * It follows that (circumference/count) (the length of the arc between two vertices, 
     * for short distances approx. a line), should be equal to 2/canvaslengthpx
     * (which computes the distance between pixels in [-1,1] canvas space)
     * -> circumference/count = 2/canvaslengthpx
     *
     * now that we have a value for (circumference/count) as well as the radius, we can calculate: count = circumf / (circumf/count)
     * with cirumf = 2 * pi * radius
     * we get count = (2*pi*radius)/(2/canvaslengthpx)
     * we can then simplify it by canceling the 2s
     * -> count = (pi*radius)/(1/canvaslengthpx)
     * and then we notice we divide by 1/canvaslengthpx which is the same as multiplying, thus we arrive at
     * -> count = pi*radius*canvaslengthpx
     * 
     * @param radius Radius of the circle.
     * @return Number of vertices.
     * @attention If we decide to support non square canvasses this needs to be changed as well.
