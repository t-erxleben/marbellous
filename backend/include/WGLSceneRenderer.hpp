/**
 * \brief Render scenes to buffers.
 * 
 *  When you have a list of vertices where neighbors in the list are adjunct vertices of a polygon,
 *  then the triangle fan of that list covers areas inside the polygon with an odd amount of triangles
 *  and areas outside of the polygon with an even amount or none.
 * 
 *  Because we draw multiple polygons on top of each other and we don't want to draw each polygon
 *  separately we need to extend this scheme.
 *
 *  We need to figure out which is the first visible polygon for an fragment.
 *  For that we initialize each fragment with an stencil value of 0b10
 *  then each time when the first triangle of an polygon is drawn on that fragment (depth test succeeds)
 *  we decrement this value, for the first polygon it is than 0b01 (an odd count).
 *  Each additional triangle over that fragment will toggle this value between 0b10 and 0b01 (even/odd count).
 *  If an polygon has an even number of triangles at this fragment (the fragment is outside of the polygon),
 *  the value will be 0b10 when the next polygon starts, and there fore the same as the initialisation.
 *  If an polygon as an odd number of triangles at this fragment (the fragment is inside the polygon),
 *  the value will be 0b01 what means if we subtract 1 now the value is 0.
 *  We use this 0 to indicate that this fragment is inside the polygon above the current one.
 *
 *  After this first draw pass, every fragment which is inside of at leas 1 polygon has an stencil value
 *  of 0 or 1. All with an one are visible so we can just draw them (this will happen in draw pass 3), 
 *  because the correct depth is stored in the depth buffer.
 *
 *  For the fragments with stencil 0 we only now the depth value of the polygon below them,
 *  so we just draw every polygon above the stored depth value, this way we will use the painter algorithm
 *  to only show the polygon direct above the stored one.
